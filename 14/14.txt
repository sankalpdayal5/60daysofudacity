*Day 14*:
:heavy_check_mark: Finalised the installations for anaconda and installed the required libraries. Also tested my previous projects and started working on the course once again.

:heavy_check_mark: Started the first project of #sg_cognitive-learners
*HotDog Classification* : level - Begginer
It is a simple image classification task where we need to classify from an image whether it contains hotdog or not. :hotdog:

:heavy_check_mark: Sorry for being inactive since the last few days. Was busy in shifting the luggage and finalising my hostel. Will be much active from tomorrow.
